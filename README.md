### Champion's Road by Lord-Giganticus

Yes I remade a SM3DW level in SMBX 2.0. It was honestly a fun expericene making it.

## Features

Getting hit while in a powerup higher than Super Mario will instead of making you small turn to Super Mario like the modern games.

I put star coins in to replicate the green stars found in the original level

Pixel perfect water movement (It's not as bad as it sounds just play smart)

2 secret levels and a secret boss

A old joke
